#Comments* #1 i am NO Gryffindor hater ;) I just feel that I wanted to push the color scheme further than the obvious reds and golds.* I applied almost all the suggestions from class: adding a drop shadow, increasing the size of the bricks, I kept the script secondary font, because I agree with you I think it adds a nice Harry Potter feel to the site. * I attempted to add a media query and change the logo to a secondary, smaller logo for mobile viewers. I could not get it to work. I commented it out in my CSS (line 87) so you could take a look and see why it is not working. I think it is something with using the h1 element. * I'm excited for your feedback; I feel like I did well on this and can't wait to improve on it.
